Perfect. Below are the three concrete deliverables, written so they can be used immediately by developers, designers, and AI coding agents.

I’ve kept this practical, explicit, and execution-ready — no fluff.

	•	Dark-first design with light fallback
	•	Mobile-first layout
	•	Max content width: 1200–1320px
	•	12-column grid on desktop

Performance
	•	Lighthouse ≥ 90 (Performance, Accessibility)

⸻

B. HERO SECTION (CRITICAL)

Visual
	•	Use provided WebP video/frames
	•	Initial state: closed treasury box
	•	End state: open box with technologies visible
	•	Background: transparent or black with soft shadow
	•	No layout shift during animation

Scroll Behavior
	•	Scroll-driven animation (NOT autoplay)
	•	Scroll progress = animation progress
	•	Smooth, weighted easing

	•	Section reveals: fade + translateY (small)
	•	Parallax max movement: 30px
	•	No bounce, elastic, or playful motion

⸻

E. FINAL QA
	•	Mobile tested on real devices
	•	Reduced-motion tested
	•	All links valid
