Website Design & Experience Standards

(Authoritative Design Specification)

⸻

1. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These principles guide every visual and interaction decision.

1.1 Credibility First
	•	Every section must answer: “Can these people deliver?”
	•	Visual richness must never obscure clarity.
	•	Avoid abstract hype, metaphors without grounding, or buzzword-heavy copy.

1.2 Cinematic, Not Decorative
	•	Motion, depth, and parallax exist to guide attention, not entertain.
	•	All animation must have purpose (hierarchy, reveal, emphasis).

1.3 Engineered Feel
	•	Everything should feel intentional, weighted, and precise.
	•	No playful bounce, no elastic easing, no randomness.

1.4 Human + AI, Clearly Framed
	•	Human expertise is primary.
	•	AI agents are an accelerator, not the face.

⸻

2. GLOBAL LAYOUT SYSTEM

2.1 Page Width & Grid
	•	Max content width: 1200–1320px
	•	Use a 12-column grid on desktop
	•	Mobile-first layout; desktop enhances, not replaces

2.2 Spacing Rules
	•	Generous vertical spacing between sections
	•	Fewer sections, stronger impact
	•	White/negative space is part of the design

2.3 Section Rhythm

Every section follows this internal rhythm:
	1.	Section label (optional, small)
	2.	Headline (strong, clear)
	3.	Supporting text (short)
	4.	Visual or structured content (cards, logos, diagrams)

⸻

3. HERO SECTION (FLAGSHIP INTERACTION)

3.1 Purpose

The hero section:
	•	Attracts attention
	•	Signals sophistication
	•	Sets tone
It does not explain everything.

3.2 Visual Concept
	•	Central element: technology treasury box
	•	Initial state: closed box
	•	On scroll: box opens and technologies emerge

3.3 Behavior
	•	Scroll-driven animation (not autoplay)
	•	Linear progress: scroll position = animation progress
	•	Smooth, weighted motion
	•	Must respect prefers-reduced-motion

3.4 Copy (LOCKED)

Headline (exact):

Inside This Box Lies the Future of Technology — Engineered by Xala Technologies.

Behavior:
	•	Fully visible when box is closed
	•	Gradually de-emphasized as box opens
	•	Final state prioritizes visuals over text

3.5 Technical Notes
	•	No layout shift
	•	Lazy-load animation assets
	•	Static fallback on low-power devices

⸻

4. CORE OFFERINGS SECTION

(“What We Actually Deliver”)

4.1 Purpose

This section must immediately ground the visitor after the hero.

4.2 Structure

Three primary pillars only:

AI Automation
	•	Practical automation of workflows, systems, and decision processes

	•	Focus on real users, real data, long-term maintenance

Blockchain & Web3
	•	Infrastructure and platforms for decentralized and hybrid systems
	•	Enterprise- and compliance-aware

4.3 Design
	•	Three equal cards or columns
	•	Calm motion on scroll
	•	Icons or visuals must be restrained and consistent

⸻

5. TRACK RECORD SECTION (CRITICAL TRUST BUILDER)

5.1 Purpose

Answer the question:

“Have they actually done this before?”

5.2 Content
	•	Years of experience
	•	Types of clients (enterprise, public sector, regulated)
	•	Nature of work (platforms, integrations, infrastructure)

5.3 Design
	•	Factual tone
	•	No exaggeration
	•	Metrics > adjectives
	•	Calm, authoritative visuals

⸻

6. CLIENTS & PARTNERS

6.1 Purpose

Demonstrate trust through association.

6.2 Design Standards
	•	Cinematic logo presentation (not a basic carousel)
	•	Smooth horizontal or layered motion
	•	Subtle depth (scale, opacity, blur at edges)
	•	Logos must remain readable at all times

6.3 Behavior
	•	Slow, confident motion
	•	No fast autoplay
	•	No flashing or snapping
